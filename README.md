# twitchBot

**SlimeStreamBot** 
This code is me practicing usage of the *twitchio API* by making my own bot in chat. As of 10/1/2023, it can read some commands and print them out, specifically to find a !twitter chat message and a !discord chat message. My goal in the future is to create a bot robust enough to work like Nightbot but catered specifically to my computer so that I can do song requests without another service.

***NOTE***: there is a .env file you need if you want to make your own Twitch chatbot (hence the os.environ['KEY'] in the constructor).
